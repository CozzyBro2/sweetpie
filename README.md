Discordia discord bot written in luvit

# Setting it up

You can use this bot yourself, if you want. I've only really tailored it around my use cases, but good luck:

* Make sure you have luvit, luvi, and lit all installed and in your $PATH, or otherwise accesible.

* Clone this repository, i.e: `git clone https://github.com/CozzyBro2/sweetpie`
* `cd sweetpie`, then `lit install` to get all the dependencies.

* create a file named `.SECRET` and make it a single line with your token on it.

* Finally, to run the bot just run `luvit src/main.lua` in the working directory, or use the `start.sh` file included. (You may need to `chmod +x start.sh` or equivalent)
